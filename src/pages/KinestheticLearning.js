          kinesthetic learning style people have trouble with learning through traditional lecture-based learning because the body fails to recognize the connection when they're listening without movement. Although their bodies are not actively involved, their minds are, which makes it more challenging for them to digest the information. They frequently need to stand up and move around in order to commit information to memory        </p>

            <strong>1. </strong> <strong style={{ color: '#353535' }}>Stand Up Instead of Sitting Down </strong>
            You are already aware of the negative effects prolonged sitting has on your health. However, did you know that standing up would enhance your knowledge and recall as a kinesthetic learner? Your body is more attentive and involved in the learning process when you are standing. A standing desk or book stand may enable you to focus for longer periods of time and retain more of what you read.
          </p>

          <p className='kinesthetic-paragraph'>
            <strong>2. </strong> Combine Your Study Session with Exercise:
            Instead of plopping on the sofa with your notes, get up and do burpees or jumping jacks in between chapters. Quiz the students while they shoot hoops or jump rope. Combining activities keep them energized and cements the ideas they study in their brain.
          </p>

          <p className='kinesthetic-paragraph'>
            <strong>3. </strong>
            Allow kinesthetic learners to stand, bounce their legs, or doodle during lectures. You will get more out of them in class if they can move around a little bit.
